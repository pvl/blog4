Plastic Labs is a research-driven company solving identity for the agentic world.

We're building [Honcho](https://honcho.dev), the social cognition layer for AI-powered applications. Honcho synthesizes high-fidelity user representations to instantly personalize the UX of entire app ecosystems--individually aligning each user's agent stack.

Radically decentralizing alignment demands a user-centric organization. We're dedicated to a multi-agent future where everyone has the power to securely augment and extend their digital agency. We believe open source artificial intelligence and subverting the status quo of user data practices are the only ways to get there.

And we believe you deny models intellectual respect at your own risk.

Plastic is seeking high-agency autodidacts to add intellectual diversity to the team. If you thrive in techno-optimistic, interdisciplinary cultures, this is the place for you. We're a subversive ethos at the edge of emerging tech, more interested in grit than credentials. We stay high touch, build in the open, and teach each other daily.

We're freshly capitalized and moving fast.

Join us. LFG.
