## About the Role

We're seeking our first developer relations engineer to accelerate Honcho's growth and ecosystem. This is a ground-floor opportunity to shape how developers discover, understand, and build with Honcho--our AI-native memory, identity, and social cognition infrastructure.

This role demands a rare combination: strong technical chops, compelling communication, authentic community instincts, and overall generalist. You'll build demos that showcase what's possible, create content that clarifies complex ideas, engage directly with developers solving real problems, and represent Plastic at the frontier of artificial intelligence. You'll move fluidly between writing code, producing tutorials, working with users, and running or attending events--always focused on maximizing growth and retention.

We need someone who can translate between technical depth and accessible explanation, who understands great DevRel, and who thrives in the chaotic early stages of building a developer community from scratch. If you're energized by shipping demos, teaching developers, and shaping how people think about personal identity in AI, this is for you.
