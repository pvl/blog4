(NYC / Remote, Part-Time)

## About the Role

We're always keenly on the lookout for talented young technologists aligned with our mission. Happy to accommodate the right fit in a variety of flexible paid formats and commitments. And we're open to creative and additive non-technical possibilities.

If you're bored at school and looking to learn by doing; have too much free time and want to get your hands dirty; or thinking about what to do next summer, hit us up.

## About You

- High cultural alignment with Plastic Labs' ethos
- Primary location +/- 3 hrs of EST
- Impulse for rapid learning & trying new tech at the edge
- Familiarity with & interest in LLMs
- Significant experience &/ interest in a number of areas described in our [[Full-Stack Engineer]], [[Founding ML Engineer]], &/ [[Founding Engineer]] "About You" sections
- Alignment with or interest in topics and fields of inquiry explored or anything on [our blog](https://blog.plasticlabs.ai)
- Complementary interest in cryptography, distributed systems, security, identity, cognitive sciences (computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, & psychology) or other adjacent interdisciplinary fields a plus

## How to Apply

Start by DM'ing us [on X](https://x.com/plastic_labs), joining [our Discord](https://discord.gg/plasticlabs) and engaging, or contributing to [our GitHub](https://github.com/plastic-labs). Don't overthink it.

If it's a fit, we'll ask you to send the following to ops@plasticlabs.ai:

- **Resume/CV** in whatever form it exists (PDF, LinkedIn, website, etc)
- **Portfolio** of notable work (GitHub, pubs, ArXiv, blog, X, etc)
- **Statement** of alignment specific to Plastic Labs--how do you identify with our mission, how can you contribute, etc? (points for brief, substantive, heterodox)

Try to cover these 3 categories in some way, but be sure to optimize for speed over perfection.
