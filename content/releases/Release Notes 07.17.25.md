## Honcho UpdatesÂ v2.1.0

Introduction of Honcho's R.O.T.E Deriver for explicit, certain reasoning over `peer` data, new "working" representations, & updates to the Dialectic API. Honcho is state of the art against SOTA evals, other memory solutions, and foundation model inference.

ADDED

- File uploads
- Brand new "ROTE" deriver system
- Updated dialectic system
- Local working representations
- Better logging for deriver/dialectic
- Endpoint for deriver queue status

CHANGED

- Dialectic chat endpoint takes a single query
- Rearranged configuration values (LLM, Deriver, Dialectic, History->Summary)

FIXED

- Document insertion
- Session-scoped and peer-targeted dialectic queries work now

REMOVED

- Peer-level messages
