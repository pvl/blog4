## News

- Tune in for Honcho Release Week next week, we'll been sharing everything we've been up to this summer, dropping something new every day!
- Upgrade to v2.3.0 for the fastest and most reliable version of Honcho! Going forward, we won't be supporting older versions.
- And check out "Teach Honcho," a community project to initialize Honcho with your ChatGPT conversations.

## Honcho UpdatesÂ v2.3.0

- Introducing Peer Cards! Peer cards summarize essential information like name, nicknames, location, age, occupation, interests/hobbies, and likes/dislikes used to improve the fidelity of the deriver and dialectic API.
- And timestamps are now configurable! That means it's way easier and more effective to import old conversations or convos from external sources (ChatGPT, Claude logs, etc).

ADDED

- `getSummaries` endpoint to get all available summaries for a session directly
- Peer Card feature to improve context for deriver and dialectic

CHANGED

- Session Peer limit to be based on observers instead, renamed config value to `SESSION_OBSERVERS_LIMIT`
- `Messages` can take a custom timestamp for the `created_at` field, defaulting to the current time
- `get_context` endpoint returns detailed `Summary` object rather than just summary content
- Working representations use a FIFO queue structure to maintain facts rather than a full rewrite
- Optimized deriver enqueue by prefetching message sequence numbers (eliminates N+1 queries)

FIXED

- Deriver uses `get_context` internally to prevent context window limit errors
- Embedding store will truncate context when querying documents to prevent embedding token limit errors
- Queue manager to schedule work based on available works rather than total number of workers
- Queue manager to use atomic db transactions rather than long lived transaction for the worker lifecycle
- Timestamp formats unified to ISO 8601 across the codebase
- Internal get_context method's cutoff value is exclusive now
